This is a proof of concept project which demonstrates:

### 1. A basic implementation pattern of MVVM with Clean Architecture extension.

It has:

- Repository
- Builder
- Wireframe

It doesn't have:

- UseCase   (merged into ViewModel)
- Presenter (merged into ViewController)
- DataStore (merged into Repository)

Clean Architecture is basically extension of MVVM, so I only chose couple of components to fit my needs for current (and potentially future) state of this project.

### 2. Micro framework architecture

There are number of frameworks:

- AbceedCore: Common types and extensions (non-UI)
- AbceedLogic: Core Business Logic (ViewModel)
- AbceedUI: Common UI Components (View, ViewController, Wireframe and Builder)

It's still proof of concept, but feels okay to me.

- `Logic` depends on `Core`
- `UI` depends on both `Core` and `Logic`

Frameworks are linked statically, so there's no runtime overhead compared to monolithic app target.

Other notes on code separation are:

- ViewModel's interface is in `Core`, ViewModel's impl is in `Logic`.
  This way `UILibrary` target doesn't require `Logic` target.

### 3. Mock data driven UI development

All UI components are separated from main target, which means I can run app target **without actual network or database I/O**.  
This allows to show interested View or ViewController independently.    
This boosts up the UI development iteration cycle especially when project gets very large.

- UILibrary: Runs UI with mock data. Could have been a Xcode Playground too.

And of-course this makes it easy to test presentation layer using UITesting or snapshot testing etc..
